\title{Construct a Combined SNN Graph Integrating Gene Expression and Spatial Coordinates}
\usage{
getCOSNN(seurat_obj, alpha, position, snn = seurat_obj@graphs$SCT_snn)
}
\arguments{
\item{seurat_obj}{A Seurat object containing single-cell or spatial data.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric scalar in [0,1]. Weight of spatial coordinate-based
SNN in the final graph. (1 - alpha) is the weight of the gene expression SNN.}

\item{position}{A matrix or data frame of spatial coordinates, with rownames
corresponding to cell/spot names and columns typically being `x, y`
(or higher-dimensional embeddings).}

\item{snn}{Gene expression-based SNN graph. Default: `seurat_obj@graphs$SCT_snn`.}
}
\value{
A sparse adjacency matrix representing the combined SNN graph.
}
\description{
This function computes a combined shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph
by integrating gene expression-based SNN from Seurat with spatial
coordinate-based SNN. The final adjacency matrix is a convex combination
of the two, controlled by parameter `alpha`.
