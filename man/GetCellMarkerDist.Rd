\title{Compute marker–cell/spot association matrix in the latent phenotype space}
\usage{
GetCellMarkerDist(
  MCA_obj = MCA_obj,
  markers = markers,
  ues_dim = 50,
  method = c("cosine", "pearcon", "spearman", "euclidean")[1]
)
}
\arguments{
\item{MCA_obj}{A list-like object representing the latent phenotype space with at least:
\itemize{
  \item featuresCoordinates: numeric matrix (features × dims) of co-embedded marker coordinates
  \item cellsCoordinates: numeric matrix (cells/spots × dims) of cell/spot embeddings in the latent space
  Row and column names should be present and consistent with marker and cell/spot identifiers.
}}

\item{markers}{Character vector of marker features ( genes / peaks) used to define the phenotype-specific signatures.}

\item{ues_dim}{Integer scalar; number of latent dimensions to use from the MCA embedding (default: 50).}

\item{method}{Character; similarity metric to quantify feature–cell association. Supported options:
\itemize{
  \item "cosine": Cosine similarity (default)
  \item "pearson": Pearson correlation
  \item "spearman": Spearman correlation
  \item "euclidean": Inverse Euclidean distance (1/(1+distance))
}}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of association scores with markers as rows and cells/spots as columns.
   Values reflect the degree of association between each marker feature and each cell/spot
  in the latent phenotype space; this matrix can be used as input for diffusion-based
  smoothing and permutation testing to derive phenotype risk scores.
}
\description{
Compute similarity scores between marker features and cells/spots using coordinates
in the latent phenotype space (MCA). The resulting marker × cell/spot matrix quantifies
feature–cell associations.
