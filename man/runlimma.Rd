\title{Identify Phenotype-specific Features with limma-voom}
\usage{
runlimma(
  bulk.count,
  conditions,
  design_formula = ~conditions,
  p.adj = 0.05,
  logFC = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bulk.count}{A count matrix with features as rows and samples as columns}

\item{conditions}{A factor vector specifying the experimental conditions}

\item{design_formula}{A formula specifying the experimental design (default: ~conditions)}

\item{p.adj}{Adjusted p-value cutoff for significance (default: 0.05)}

\item{logFC}{Minimum absolute log2 fold-change threshold (default: 0)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item Full limma results table (all features)
  \item Filtered results containing only significant features meeting p.adj and logFC thresholds
}
}
\description{
Performs differential analysis using limma-voom for bulk RNA-seq data with binary phenotypes.
Top features significantly associated with the phenotype are selected and assigned log2 fold-change
weights.
