\title{Identify Phenotype-specific Features with edgeR}
\usage{
runedgeR(
  bulk.count,
  group,
  design_formula = ~ed_phenotype,
  p.adj = 0.05,
  logFC = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bulk.count}{A count matrix with features as rows and samples as columns}

\item{group}{A vector or factor specifying the experimental groups}

\item{design_formula}{A formula specifying the experimental design (default: ~ed_phenotype)}

\item{p.adj}{Adjusted p-value cutoff for significance (default: 0.05)}

\item{logFC}{Minimum absolute log2 fold-change threshold (default: 0)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item Full edgeR results table (all features)
  \item Filtered results containing only significant features meeting p.adj and logFC thresholds
}
}
\description{
Similar to DESeq2, uses edgeR for differential analysis on bulk counts for binary phenotypes.
Features significantly associated with the target phenotype are selected as markers, and
log2 fold-change values are used as importance weights for downstream CPlink analysis.
