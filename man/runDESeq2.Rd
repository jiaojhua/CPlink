\usage{
runDESeq2(
  bulk.count,

  design_formula = ~phenotype,

\arguments{
\item{bulk.count}{A count matrix with features as rows and samples as columns}

\item{bulk.meta}{A data frame containing sample metadata with matching row names to count columns}

\item{design_formula}{A formula specifying the experimental design (default: ~ phenotype)}

\item{pAdjustMethod}{Method for p-value adjustment ("fdr", "BH", "bonferroni", etc.)}

\item{p.adj}{Adjusted p-value cutoff for significance (default: 0.05)}

\item{logFC}{Minimum absolute log2 fold-change threshold (default: 0)}

\item{parallel}{Logical indicating whether to use parallel processing (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item Full DESeq2 results object (all features)
  \item Filtered results containing only significant features meeting p.adj and logFC thresholds
}
}
\description{
For binary group phenotypes (e.g., disease vs. control), this function performs differential
feature analysis on bulk count data using DESeq2. Features significantly associated
with the phenotype are ranked, and top features are selected as potential phenotype-specific markers.
The log2 fold-change values are used as phenotype-specific importance weights.
