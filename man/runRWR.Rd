\title{Random Walk with Restart (RWR) diffusion on a cell/spot graph}
\usage{
runRWR(mtx, seedcells, restart_prob = 0.05, conv_threshold = 1e-05)
}
\arguments{
\item{mtx}{Numeric matrix representing the adjacency / transition counts
between nodes. Rows/columns correspond to the same set of nodes.
The function will convert this to a column-stochastic transition
matrix internally.}

\item{seedcells}{Character vector or integer indices specifying seed nodes.}

\item{restart_prob}{Restart probability (scalar in [0,1]). Typical
values (e.g. 0.05) preserve local propagation while allowing return
to seeds.}

\item{conv_threshold}{Convergence threshold on L1 change between iterations.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations to run (guards against non-convergence).}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of diffusion scores for each node.
}
\description{
Implements a random-walk-with-restart diffusion process to propagate
seed signals over a cell/spot similarity/adjacency matrix. This routine
follows the formulation commonly used in CPlink: starting from a
probability vector concentrated on seed nodes, the score is iteratively
diffused along edges with periodic restarting to the seed distribution.
