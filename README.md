# CPlink: Linking Cells or spots to clinical Phenotypes
Mapping clinical phenotype to single-cell and spatial omics profiles 

## Overview
We introduce CPlink, an interpretable, unified, and flexible computational framework that identifies clinical phenotype-associated cells or spots from single-cell or spatial omics data, leveraging reference bulk omics data for enhanced disease prediction and biological discovery.

# Installation
To run ``CPlink`` R package, install from GitHub through ``devtools`` directly:
```R
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("jiaojhua/CPlink")
```

# Tutorials
CPlink is designed to identify cells or spots associated with phenotypes by transferring prior phenotype knowledge from bulk or predefined signature data to single-cell or spatial omics data. Here, we provide example workflows for multiple modality data.

* **Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data**  
  CPlink requires as input the ST count matrix, spot metadata, spatial coordinates, and the bulk RNA-seq count matrix with corresponding phenotype metadata.  

  Examples of CPlink applied to ST data: [Tutorial](https://github.com/jiaojhua/CPlink/blob/main/vignettes/Tutorial-ST.ipynb) | [Data](https://github.com/jiaojhua/CPlink_analysis/tree/main/Testdata/ST)

* **Single-cell RNA-seq data**  
  CPlink requires as input the scRNA-seq count matrix, cell metadata, as well as the bulk RNA-seq count matrix and corresponding phenotype metadata.

* **Single-cell ATAC-seq data**
  
  CPlink requires as input the scATAC-seq count matrix, cell metadata, fragment files, as well as the bulk ATAC-seq count matrix and corresponding phenotype metadata.

* **CPlinkPrior (predefined feature signatures)**  
  CPlinkPrior uses a user-defined set of phenotype-associated features or genomic regions collected from public databases or literature as prior biological knowledge. In this case, CPlinkPrior requires as input a count matrix from the target single-cell or spatial data, associated cell/spot metadata, spatial coordinates(for ST), and a user-defined set of phenotype-relevant signatures.
